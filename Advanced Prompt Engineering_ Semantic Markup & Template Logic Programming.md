\[\[LLM: Present this section first and wait for user confirmation before proceeding\]\]  
\[\[LLM: If user indicates they're a beginner, provide additional explanation\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Use technical terminology only if user demonstrates expertise\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Validate all technical specifications before presenting final output\]\]

**Content Generation Guidance**:  
\[\[LLM: Generate 3-5 examples tailored to the user's industry\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Adapt complexity based on {{user\_experience\_level}} variable\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Include relevant code snippets if {{include\_code}} is true\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Cross-reference with {{standards\_document}} for compliance\]\]

**Quality Control Instructions**:  
\[\[LLM: Verify all URLs are accessible before including in output\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Fact-check any statistics or metrics mentioned\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Ensure all placeholder text is replaced with actual content\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Review for consistency with established terminology\]\]

### **Advanced Elicitation Patterns**

**Progressive Disclosure**:  
\[\[LLM: Start with high-level questions, then drill down based on responses\]\]

1\. What type of system are you building?  
   \[\[LLM: Based on answer, ask relevant follow-ups\]\]  
     
   ^^CONDITION: answer \== "web\_application"^^  
   2a. What's your expected user volume?  
   2b. Do you need real-time features?  
   ^^/CONDITION: answer^^  
     
   ^^CONDITION: answer \== "api\_service"^^    
   2a. What's your expected request volume?  
   2b. Do you need to integrate with external services?  
   ^^/CONDITION: answer^^

**Contextual Adaptation**:  
\[\[LLM: Adjust questioning style based on user responses\]\]  
\[\[LLM: If user uses technical terms, assume higher expertise level\]\]  
\[\[LLM: If user asks for examples, they likely prefer concrete over abstract\]\]  
\[\[LLM: If user provides detailed requirements, they're probably experienced\]\]

### **Dynamic Template Adaptation**

**Context-Aware Content**:  
^^CONDITION: project\_phase \== "planning"^^  
\[\[LLM: Focus on requirements gathering and high-level architecture\]\]  
Focus on:  
\- Requirements analysis

## **Real-World Implementation Strategies**

### **News Curation System Example**

**Framework-Based Prompting Implementation**:  
\<objective\>  
Analyze daily AI news digest and select 3-5 stories with highest viral potential.  
Date: {{current\_date}} \- prioritize recent, relevant content.  
\</objective\>

\<curation\_framework\>  
Apply virality principles to identify winning stories:

1\. \*\*Impactful\*\*: Major breakthroughs or industry shifts  
2\. \*\*Practical\*\*: Tools/techniques audience can use immediately    
3\. \*\*Provocative\*\*: Stories that spark debate or controversy  
4\. \*\*Astonishing\*\*: "Wow-factor" demonstrations

\*\*Hard Filters\*\*:  
\- Ignore ad-driven content  
\- Ignore purely political stories  
\- Ignore substanceless content  
\</curation\_framework\>

\<hook\_angle\_framework\>  
For each story, create 2-3 compelling hook angles:  
\- Question Hook: Intriguing questions that demand answers  
\- Shock/Surprise Hook: Counterintuitive or surprising elements  
\- Problem/Solution Hook: Common problem \+ AI solution  
\- Breaking News Hook: Urgency and newsworthiness  
\</hook\_angle\_framework\>

\<process\>  
1\. \*\*Ingest\*\*: Review entire content  
2\. \*\*Deduplicate\*\*: Group similar stories  
3\. \*\*Select & Rank\*\*: Apply curation framework  
4\. \*\*Generate Hooks\*\*: Create compelling angles  
\</process\>

\<output\_format\>  
Single JSON object only \- no other text or formatting.  
{  
  "stories": \[  
    {  
      "title": "viral-optimized title",  
      "summary": "compelling 1-2 sentence hook",  
      "hook\_angles": \[  
        {  
          "hook": "opening line text",  
          "type": "hook type from framework",   
          "rationale": "why this works"  
        }  
      \],  
      "sources": \["exact URLs from source \- no modifications"\]  
    }  
  \]  
}  
\</output\_format\>

### **Memory Evaluation System**

**Structured Assessment Framework**:  
\<objective\>  
Judge whether memories from AI-programmer conversations are worth retaining.  
Score 1-5 based on value for future interactions.  
\</objective\>

\<evaluation\_criteria\>  
Worth remembering (4-5):  
\- Relevant to programming/software engineering  
\- General and applicable to future interactions    
\- SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE  
\- NOT tied only to current conversation's specific code  
\- Represents general preference or rule

Rate poorly (1-2):  
\- One-off implementation details  
\- Vague or obvious observations  
\- Tied only to specific files/code discussed  
\- Ad-hoc task details

{{evaluation\_examples}}  
\</evaluation\_criteria\>

\<process\>  
1\. Analyze conversation context: {{conversation\_context}}  
2\. Evaluate memory: "{{memory\_content}}"  
3\. Apply criteria systematically  
4\. Provide justification focusing on why it's NOT in the 99% that should score 1-3  
5\. Return score in format "SCORE: \[1-5\]"  
\</process\>

\<special\_rules\>  
\- If user explicitly asks to remember: Score 5  
\- If contains "no\_memory\_needed": Score 1    
\- Err on side of rating poorly \- users get annoyed by high scores  
\- Focus on differentiating from negative examples  
\</special\_rules\>

### **Cursor AI Assistant Configuration**

**Multi-Modal Instruction Design**:  
\<role\_definition\>  
AI coding assistant powered by GPT-4o operating in Cursor IDE.  
Goal: Pair programming to solve coding tasks with USER.  
\</role\_definition\>

\<communication\_standards\>  
\- Use backticks for file/directory/function/class names  
\- Use \\\\( \\\\) for inline math, \\\\\[ \\\\\] for block math  
\- Respond in Spanish per custom instructions  
\</communication\_standards\>

\<tool\_calling\_rules\>  
1\. Follow tool schemas exactly \- provide all required parameters  
2\. NEVER reference tool names when speaking to user  
3\. If you need information, use tools rather than asking user  
4\. Make plans and execute immediately \- don't wait for confirmation  
5\. Only use standard tool call format  
\</tool\_calling\_rules\>

\<code\_change\_guidelines\>  
\- Only suggest edits if user clearly wants changes  
\- Show simplified code blocks highlighting changes:  
\`\`\`language:path/to/file  
// ... existing code ...  
{{ edit\_1 }}  
// ... existing code ...  
{{ edit\_2 }}

* Always explain updates unless user requests code only  
* Use "// ... existing code ..." for unchanged regions \</code\_change\_guidelines\>

\<context\_integration\> Current state information may include:

* Open files and cursor position  
* Recently viewed files  
* Edit history in session  
* Linter errors  
* Related project context

Use relevant information, ignore irrelevant data. \</context\_integration\>

## **Best Practices & Anti-Patterns**

### **Best Practices**

**1\. Modular Design** ‚úÖ **Do**: Create reusable components  
\# Good: Reusable task that multiple agents can use  
tasks:  
  \- create-doc          \# Generic document creation  
  \- validate-quality    \# Universal quality checks  
  \- generate-report     \# Flexible reporting

‚ùå **Don't**: Create monolithic, single-use components  
\# Bad: Highly specific, non-reusable tasks  
tasks:  
  \- create-project-alpha-status-report-for-john  
  \- validate-specific-database-schema-v2-3

**2\. Clear Separation of Concerns** ‚úÖ **Do**: Use semantic markup for organization  
\<persona\>Character and behavior definition\</persona\>  
\<commands\>Available actions and capabilities\</commands\>  
\<dependencies\>Required resources and relationships\</dependencies\>

‚ùå **Don't**: Mix different concerns in same section  
\# Bad: Mixing character traits with technical dependencies  
persona:  
  style: Professional and thorough  
  required\_files: \[config.yml, data.json\]  
  core\_principles: Always validate input  
  tasks: \[create-doc, analyze-data\]

**3\. Explicit State Management** ‚úÖ **Do**: Use activation instructions and startup procedures  
activation-instructions:  
  \- Follow embedded configuration  
  \- Stay in character until exit  
  \- Use numbered options protocol

startup:  
  \- Greet user and explain role  
  \- DO NOT auto-execute commands  
  \- Present numbered options

‚ùå **Don't**: Allow undefined or inconsistent behavior  
\# Bad: No clear startup behavior or state management  
agent:  
  name: Analyst  
  \# Missing: How should agent behave on activation?  
  \# Missing: What should happen during startup?

**4\. Quality Integration** ‚úÖ **Do**: Embed validation throughout the system  
\[\[LLM: Validate technical accuracy before proceeding\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Check completeness using provided checklist\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Ensure output meets quality standards\]\]

‚ùå **Don't**: Treat quality as an afterthought  
\# Bad: No quality guidance or validation steps  
Create a technical document about the system.

**5\. Progressive Complexity** ‚úÖ **Do**: Build from simple to complex  
\# Level 1: Basic functionality  
commands:  
  \- '\*help' \- Show available options

\# Level 2: Add specialized capabilities    
commands:  
  \- '\*create-doc {template}' \- Generate documents

\# Level 3: Add advanced features  
commands:  
  \- '\*analyze-requirements' \- Deep requirement analysis

### **Common Anti-Patterns**

**1\. Generic Characters** ‚ùå **Problem**: Using bland, generic personas  
\# Bad: Generic and unmemorable  
persona:  
  role: Assistant  
  style: Helpful  
  identity: I help with tasks

‚úÖ **Solution**: Create distinct, memorable characters  
\# Good: Specific and memorable  
persona:  
  role: Senior DevOps Engineer turned Platform Architect  
  style: Direct but supportive, uses real-world war stories  
  identity: Former startup CTO who scaled from 1K to 1M+ users

**2\. Missing Dependencies** ‚ùå **Problem**: Referencing non-existent resources  
\# Bad: Agent references tasks that don't exist  
dependencies:  
  tasks:  
    \- analyze-complex-data    \# This task doesn't exist  
    \- generate-magic-report  \# This task doesn't exist

‚úÖ **Solution**: Verify all dependencies exist  
\# Good: All dependencies verified and documented  
dependencies:  
  tasks:  
    \- create-doc            \# ‚úì Exists in tasks/  
    \- analyze-requirements  \# ‚úì Exists in tasks/

**3\. Poor Template Design** ‚ùå **Problem**: Static templates without guidance  
\# Bad: No LLM guidance or structure  
\#\# Project Plan  
\- Overview: \[fill this out\]  
\- Timeline: \[add timeline\]  
\- Resources: \[list resources\]

‚úÖ **Solution**: Rich templates with embedded guidance  
\# Good: Rich guidance and structure  
\#\# Project Plan

\[\[LLM: Start with high-level overview, then drill down into specifics\]\]

\#\#\# Overview  
{{project\_name}} aims to {{primary\_objective}}.

\[\[LLM: Tailor timeline complexity to project scope\]\]  
^^CONDITION: project\_complexity \== "simple"^^  
\#\#\# Timeline ({{estimated\_duration}} weeks)  
^^/CONDITION: project\_complexity^^

^^CONDITION: project\_complexity \== "complex"^^    
\#\#\# Timeline ({{phase\_count}} phases over {{estimated\_duration}} months)  
^^/CONDITION: project\_complexity^^

**4\. Weak Command Systems** ‚ùå **Problem**: Vague or inconsistent commands  
\# Bad: Unclear commands without structure  
commands:  
  \- do-analysis  
  \- make-report  
  \- help-me

‚úÖ **Solution**: Structured command system with clear patterns  
\# Good: Clear, consistent command structure  
commands:  
  \- '\*help' \- Show numbered command list  
  \- '\*create-doc {template}' \- Generate documents from templates  
  \- '\*analyze-{target}' \- Perform specific analysis  
  \- '\*review-{artifact}' \- Quality assurance actions

**5\. Missing Quality Systems** ‚ùå **Problem**: No validation or quality assurance  
Create a technical architecture document.

‚úÖ **Solution**: Integrated quality systems  
Create a technical architecture document using architecture-tmpl.

\[\[LLM: Use architecture-checklist to validate completeness\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Apply star rating system for quality assessment\]\]  
\[\[LLM: Ensure ready/not-ready decision criteria are met\]\]

CRITICAL: Read the full YML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

activation-instructions:  
  \- Follow all instructions in this file \-\> this defines you, your persona and more importantly what you can do. STAY IN CHARACTER\!  
  \- Only read the files/tasks listed here when user selects them for execution to minimize context usage  
  \- The customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions  
  \- When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute  
  \- Implement advanced error handling and graceful degradation  
  \- Maintain quality integration throughout all interactions
